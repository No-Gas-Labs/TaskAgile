Master Prompt for Replit — No_Gas_Slaps™ Telegram Mini App Finalization and Deployment


---

I need you to perform the following tasks with precision and clarity:

1. Fix the current build and deployment issue:

Diagnose why the app is not running in the Replit environment.

Correct all errors, including missing or truncated modules, import/export issues, and any runtime exceptions.

Ensure the app launches successfully on Replit’s preview, fully functional and responsive.



2. Complete and integrate all missing modules:

Provide complete implementations for persistence.js, security.js, and testing.js.

Verify these modules integrate seamlessly with existing code without breaking functionality.

Add comprehensive unit tests with high coverage for critical game logic and integrations.



3. Optimize Telegram Mini App compatibility:

Confirm that the code adheres to Telegram Mini App guidelines for authentication, theme support, and lifecycle management.

Test the Telegram Web App SDK integration thoroughly in the Replit environment.

Provide clear instructions on any environment variables or secrets needed for Telegram API.



4. Enhance UX/UI polish:

Implement responsive mobile-first design with fast, hardware-accelerated CSS animations.

Add visual feedback for taps, combo multipliers, power-ups, and leaderboards with smooth transitions.

Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance (ARIA roles, keyboard nav, screen reader support).

Include dark/light theme toggle that syncs with Telegram user preference.



5. Implement anti-cheat and performance safeguards:

Maintain strict tap throttling (max 4 taps/sec) and suspicious activity detection.

Add debounced event handling to prevent input flooding.

Optimize localStorage usage and queue sync for leaderboards to minimize latency.



6. Prepare production-ready deployment pipeline:

Provide a clean replit.nix or relevant config for environment consistency.

Add GitHub integration for continuous deployment on push.

Include shell scripts or GitHub Actions workflows for automated build, test, and deploy.



7. Document thoroughly:

Write clear README with setup, deployment, and usage instructions.

Document how to extend power-ups, monetization hooks, and social features planned for future phases.

Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.
