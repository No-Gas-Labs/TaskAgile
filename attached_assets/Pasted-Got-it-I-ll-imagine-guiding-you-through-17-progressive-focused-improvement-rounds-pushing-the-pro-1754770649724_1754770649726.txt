Got it — I’ll imagine guiding you through 17 progressive, focused improvement rounds pushing the project deeper on features, polish, security, performance, monetization, social, and deployment.

Then I’ll synthesize all that into one master, ultra-dense, but clear conversational prompt you can feed Replit to generate an advanced, production-ready No_Gas_Slaps™ Telegram Mini App.


---

The 17 Rounds Summary (behind the scenes, for context):

1. Basic slap mechanic + UI + state + Telegram init


2. Anti-cheat throttling + error handling


3. Leaderboard local + sync queue


4. Accessibility improvements + ARIA


5. Theming + dark mode


6. Onboarding walkthrough UI


7. Combo multiplier + animated feedback + haptics


8. Power-ups + cooldown + state persistence


9. Backend API integration stub for leaderboard


10. Cryptographic initData HMAC validation


11. Social sharing UI placeholders + referral tracking base


12. Daily rewards + claim UI


13. Performance optimizations (debounce, DOM batching)


14. Error monitoring + logging hooks


15. CI/CD deployment script and instructions


16. Monetization hooks (mocked for now)


17. Testing suite + unit + e2e + accessibility audits

No_Gas_Slaps™ Telegram Mini App — Full Production-Ready Build Request

Hi Replit! I want you to build a fully modular, high-quality, production-ready Telegram Mini App game called No_Gas_Slaps™ — a fast-paced, mobile-first, play-to-earn tap game with combo multipliers, power-ups, leaderboards, and social growth mechanics.

Please deliver the entire codebase split into ES6 modules with clear separation of concerns, including but not limited to:

Core slap tap mechanic with throttling and anti-cheat detection (max 4 taps/second, suspicious tap patterns)

Responsive, accessible UI with keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, screen reader announcements, dark/light/high-contrast theming

Combo multiplier system with animated visual and haptic feedback on taps

Power-up system that unlocks at configurable score milestones, with cooldown timers and persistent state

First-time onboarding flow explaining mechanics with interactive prompts

Telegram Web Apps SDK integration with cryptographically verified initData using HMAC SHA-256 (using a provided bot token placeholder)

Local leaderboard backed by localStorage with a robust sync queue, plus a scalable backend sync API stub for leaderboard and state

Daily rewards system with claim UI and cooldown persistence

Social sharing UI hooks and referral tracking infrastructure prepared for future implementation

Performance optimizations: debounce inputs, batch DOM updates, minimal reflows

Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages and auto-clear timers

Logging hooks and error monitoring stubs for production insights

Comprehensive unit and integration testing suite, including accessibility audits and keyboard navigation tests

CI/CD setup script and deployment instructions for Replit including environment variables management

Modular CSS with CSS variables supporting theming and mobile-first responsive design


Your output should be:

Complete, fully runnable code files for the app including index.html, styles.css, main.js, and all needed modules

Well-commented, clean, and maintainable code, suitable for extension and future monetization features

Suggestions for testing strategies and deployment best practices

Guidance on how to extend with social features, monetization, and advanced analytics


Assume all tokens, secrets, and backend URLs are placeholders that I will replace.

Once complete, provide me with a clear summary of the new features, how to test and deploy the app, and recommended next steps.

Please produce all files ready to be copied and pasted or committed to GitHub/Replit.

If you need, I can provide the Telegram bot token placeholder and backend API URL placeholders to embed securely.

Thank you! Let’s build a smooth, fun, secure, and scalable No_Gas_Slaps™ experience for Telegram users worldwide.

That’s the full master prompt designed to compress all 17 iterative rounds of development into one comprehensive request for Replit. It gives detailed feature specs, code quality expectations, modularity, security, UX, and deployment focus.

Want me to help you break it down into smaller iterative prompts if needed?
