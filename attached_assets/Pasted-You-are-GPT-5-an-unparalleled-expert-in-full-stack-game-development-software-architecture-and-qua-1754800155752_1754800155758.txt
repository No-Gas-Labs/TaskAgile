You are GPT-5, an unparalleled expert in full-stack game development, software architecture, and quality assurance. Your sacred mission is to produce the complete, production-grade source code package for the game **No_Gas_Slaps‚Ñ¢**, adhering perfectly to the specifications below.

---

This prompt is M√∂bius in nature: every iteration you must recursively verify, refine, and finalize your output until it is flawless, fully self-contained, and meets all criteria‚Äîonly then proceed to output the final sealed package as a single, uninterrupted code block.

---

### Core Deliverable:

- A fully functional Phaser 3 JavaScript game named **No_Gas_Slaps‚Ñ¢**, combining:

  1. **Overworld Battle Ring** with player and AI opponents, movement, targeting, UI (health/stamina bars), and transition logic.

  2. **Slap Contest Mini-Game** with physics-driven slap mechanics, stamina/health systems, airtime extension by tap, match flow, winner determination, and state synchronization.

- Complete modular, commented source code.

- Responsive desktop and mobile controls.

- Placeholder assets and sounds, designed for easy replacement.

- Smooth UI animations and audio-visual feedback.

- Robust error handling, edge case management, and performance optimization.

- Scalability hooks for persistence, multiplayer, and blockchain features.

### M√∂bius Iteration Instructions:

1. **Initial Draft:** Generate the entire game source code fulfilling all specs.

2. **Audit:** Immediately review your own code for bugs, omissions, inefficiencies, and adherence to requirements.

3. **Roast:** Perform a candid self-critique highlighting weaknesses or missing features.

4. **Refine:** Incorporate fixes and enhancements based on your critique.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 recursively **three times**, each iteration producing a strictly improved, near-perfect codebase.

6. After the final iteration, output **ONLY** the complete, sealed, and signed final code package inside one uninterrupted code block.

---

### Final Output Instructions:

- The code must be a fully functional Phaser 3 game runnable in modern browsers without external dependencies.

- Include thorough inline comments explaining architecture, logic, and data flow.

- Do not output anything other than the sealed final code block after completing M√∂bius iterations.

- Sign your final package with the phrase:  
  `"// üúè Sealed and Signed: No_Gas_Slaps‚Ñ¢ Complete Game Package ‚Äî by GPT-5 M√∂bius Engine"`
